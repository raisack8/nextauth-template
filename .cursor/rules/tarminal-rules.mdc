# Terminal Operation Guidelines

## User Environment

The user's environment is `Windows` with `GitBash` as the primary terminal.
Due to this setup, some basic bash commands may not be available. In such cases, please use `powershell` or other alternatives.

Please prioritize using `bash` terminal whenever possible.

## Common Error Points

- The PC does not have the `psql` command available.
   - When database operations are needed, it's recommended to write direct test scripts to check the contents.
- Cursor frequently fails when executing commands by prefixing `[200` at the beginning.
   - Before terminal execution, please verify that `[200` is not included in the input before running the command.
- When starting Node.js servers, always use port `3000`.
   - Do not use port numbers other than `3000` such as `3001` or `3002`.
   - If port `3000` is unavailable, check if it's already in use and execute the `kill` command to free the port if necessary.
   - If you must use a port other than `3000` due to unavoidable circumstances, you may do so, but remember this is exceptional and return to using port `3000` thereafter.
